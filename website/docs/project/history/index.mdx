# The history of xcdl

The current project was created in **November 2024**, but its origins
are from early 2000.

## Prehistory

The first contact with configuration definitions languages happened in the early 2000, when I used eCos in an embedded project. Since the GUI based eCos configuration tools were mainly Windows tools, and at that time I was a hard core command line Unix user, the configuration framework was more of a nuisance than a useful technology.

The situation changed when work started on µOS++, a C++ embedded framework. Although the design was influenced by eCos, the eCos CDL was considered too eCos specific to be useful in other projects, not to mention that Tcl was already a bit too rusty, even then.

However, after using µOS++ for several years, it became clear that managing large collections of sources without an automated tool is more and more difficult.

## December 2012

In December 2012, after several studies the idea of a Python implementation of a CDL proved feasible, and a rapid prototyping version in Python was implemented.

To give this new project a new home, the SourceForge project
[eXtensible Component Definition Language](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xcdl/)
was created, basically a Git repository and two ticketing systems, one for bugs and one for feature requests, complemented by a
[Wiki](https://xcdl.sourceforge.net/wiki/).

## January 2013

In January 2013, after the successful rapid prototyping phase, the SRS wiki page was written, followed by the xCDL Definition Reference for all objects and properties.

This was followed by a more or less exhaustive implementation, and on January 13th the xCDL framework produced the first functional run of a build generated with the configMakefile tool, the conversions test for the Debug class.

## April 2014

In early 2014, ARM released a preliminary version of CMSIS Pack, as a *"a delivery mechanism for software components, device parameters, and evaluation board support"*. Although far from eCos and aiming at different purposes, the CMSIS Pack was considered an important step forward, and discussions with the CMSIS team; on April 14th an invitation to join the internal CMSIS Google Group was received.

On April 27th, a branch was created in the GNU ARM Eclipse repository, and work on an Eclipse plug-in to manage xCDL/CMSIS packs was started.

The first goal was to write a plug-in to manage the existing [Keil CMSIS packages](https://www.keil.com/pack), to be used as a base for future xCDL specific extensions. The release candidate of the packs manager plug-in was made available for review on June 16th, 2014.

## June 2014

In June 2014, a more or less complete set of specifications, based on *The eCos Component Writer's Guide*, with multiple changes, was put together on the xCDL MediaWiki site.

## August 2015

In August 2015, the project wiki was migrated to GitHub Wiki. The initial version is still available from [SourceForge](https://xcdl.sourceforge.net/wiki/).

## October 2015

In October 2015, the GitHub Wiki pages were migrated to [GitHub Pages](https://xcdl.github.io), as XCDL.

## February 2017

In February 2017, after the xPack project was created, the name was
changed to **xPack/XCDL**, with the intent to include the CDL
functionality into the xPack project.

Development on the component configurations specific features was
postponed in favour
of dependencies management and build configurations,
handled by **xpm*.

## November 2024

In November 2024 the [`xcdl-cli-ts`](https://github.com/xpack/xcdl-cli-ts/)
project was created, to host the
development of the new TypeScript version.

The documentation from the old Jekyll site was migrated to Docusaurus
and updated to JSON, to be used as specifications to implement
the TypeScript application (planned for 2025).
