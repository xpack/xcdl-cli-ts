The first [wiki](https://xcdl.sourceforge.net/wiki/XCDL_(eXtensible_Component_Definition_Language)_Wiki) pages
for the xCDL project were written in 2013, after the
first experiments with the Python version were performed
(refer to the _Old version (Python) pages_).

In **October 2015**, the site was migrated to GitHub Pages under the name of
[XCDL](http://xcdl.github.io), using an in-house developed Jekyll Wiki-like
theme. In 2017 the name was revised to
**xPack/XCDL**, to signify its association with the xPack project,
but further work on the XML based version was deferred.

In **November 2024**, the `xcdl-cli-ts` project was initiated to
facilitate the development of the new TypeScript version.
