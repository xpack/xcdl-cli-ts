The first [wiki](https://xcdl.sourceforge.net/wiki/XCDL_(eXtensible_Component_Definition_Language)_Wiki) pages
for the xCDL were written in 2013, when the
first experiments with the Python version were performed
(see the _Old version (Python) pages_).

In **October 2015** the site was migrated to GitHub Pages as
[XCDL](http://xcdl.github.io), using an in-house Jekyll Wiki-like theme.
In 2017 the name was adjusted to
**xPack/XCDL**, to mark its relationship with the xPack project,
but work on the XML based version was postponed.

In November 2024, the `xcdl-cli-ts` project was created, to host
the development of the new TypeScript version.
