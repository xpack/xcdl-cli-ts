<summary>Why not `kconfig`?</summary>

[Kconfig](https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/kconfig-language.html#),
is the configuration mechanism originally used by the
Linux kernel and later adopted by other projects too.

Although the goals are somehow similar, the concepts differ.
The language employs a custom syntax, and generally,
using it for typical embedded projects can be a challenge.
