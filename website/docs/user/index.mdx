# How to use xcdl

This section is intended for those who plan to use **xcdl** in their
own projects.

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

The first step in understanding **xcdl** is learning how to
use it in existing xcdl-enabled projects.

The subsequent steps,
which involve adding xCDL metadata to existing projects, are presented
in the [Components Author's Guide](/docs/guide/) page.

## Use existing xcdl-enabled projects

For projects that already include xCDL metadata, the basic xCDL workflow
consists of these primary tasks:

- create the xCDL configuration
- generate the build tree
- run the build
- eventually run/debug the resulting artefact

The simplest way to experiment with this workflow is by using an
existing project. For example, you can start with a basic C project
that prints the traditional _"Hello, World!"_ message.

The first step is to clone the demo project into a temporary folder
of your choice:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xpack/xcdl-demo-hello1.git
```

:::note

The demo project is not yet available.

### Install dependencies

A preliminary step in the workflow is to satisfy the project dependencies.
In this example, **xpm** will install **clang**
(since it is more portable than gcc).

```sh
cd xcdl-demo-hello1
xpm install
```

### Check configuration

The demo project already has the xCDL configuration.

You can inspect it with:

```console
% xcdl config list --config demo
...
```

### Create the build tree

```sh
xpm run prepare
```

The above **xpm** action will run the `xcdl setup` command:

```sh
xcdl setup --configuration-name demo --build-folder build/demo --builder 'xcdl-make' --toolchain-file=clang.json
```

This will create the build tree in the `build/demo` folder.

### Build the artefact

The next action is to build the executable:

```sh
xpm run build
```

This will run the `xcdl build` command, which in turn will run `make`:

```console
% xcdl build --build-folder build/demo
...
```

### Run the program

The final step is to execute the program:

```console
% build/demo/hello1
Hello World!
```

TODO:
- use a toolchain file to pass the clang definitions
- add a more elaborate demo, with several components and options to
be configured, and show how the configuration process looks like,
both in VS Code and in a terminal.
