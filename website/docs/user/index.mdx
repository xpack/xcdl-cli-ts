# How to use xcdl

This section is intended for those who plan to use this
module in their
own projects.


The `xcdl` module can be imported into both TypeScript
and JavaScript Node.js code.

In TypeScript and ECMAScript modules, use `import`:

```typescript
import { Xxx } from 'xcdl'
```

In JavaScript with CommonJS, use `require()`:

```javascript
const { Xxx } = request('xcdl')
```
