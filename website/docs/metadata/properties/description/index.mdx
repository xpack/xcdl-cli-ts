# The `description` definition

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Purpose

Provide a textual description for a configuration object.

## Syntax

```json {4}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "<name>": {
            "description": "<string>",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The value of the `description` property is a reasonably long string, typically a paragraph, ending with a period.

## Default value

If missing, the value remains an empty string, but it is highly recommended to explicitly define it.

## Description

When presented with a (graphical) user interface, users can only be expected to manipulate configuration options sensibly if they are given sufficient information about these options. There are three properties which serve to explain an object in plain text: the `display` property gives a textual alias for an object, which is usually more comprehensible than something like CYGPKG_LIBC_TIME_ZONES; the `description` property gives a longer description, typically a paragraph or so; the `docsUrl` property specifies the location of additional on-line documentation related to a configuration object.

In the context of a graphical tool, the `display` string will be the primary way for users to identify configuration objects; the `description` paragraph will be visible whenever the object is selected; the on-line documentation will only be accessed when the user explicitly requests it.

Text is rendered as a long line. For multi-line descriptions, use `\n` as line separators.

At present there is no way of providing any sort of formatting markup in a description. It is possible that future versions of the configuration tools will provide some control over the way the description text gets rendered, most likely using a subset of the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) syntax.

## Example

```json {5}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "trace-message": {
            "display": "Use trace text",
            "description": "All trace calls within eCos contain a text message which should give some information about the circumstances. These text messages will end up being embedded in the  application image and hence there is a significant penalty  in terms of image size.\n It is possible to suppress the use of these messages by disabling this option.\n This results in smaller code size, but there is less human-readable information available in the trace output, possibly only filenames and line numbers.",
            "parent": "infra-debug",
            "defaultValue": "1",
            "generatedDefinition": "CYGDBG_INFRA_DEBUG_TRACE_MESSAGE"
        }
    }
}
```
