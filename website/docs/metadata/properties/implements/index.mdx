# The `implements` definition

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Purpose

Inform the framework that one or more general interfaces are implemented.

## Syntax

```json
    <option name="...">

      <display>...</display>
      <description>...</description>

      <implements>interface 1</implements>
      <implements>interface 2</implements>

      ... other properties ...
      ... children objects ...

    </option>
```

The value of the `implements` property is a list of ids of interfaces the object implements. Multiple instances of this property are allowed.

## Default value

If missing it is assumed that the current object does not implement any interface.

## Description

The xCDL interface concept provides an abstraction mechanism that can be useful in many different circumstances. Essentially an interface is a computed option whose value is the number of active and enabled objects which implement that interface. For example the `interface('kernel/scheduler')` has a value corresponding to the number of schedulers in the system, typically just one.

The implements property takes a single argument, which should be a list of ids of the implemented interfaces (an object may implement multiple interfaces). These interface may be defined in the same package as the implementor or in some other package. In the latter case it may sometimes be appropriate for the implementor or the implementor's package to have a `requires` property for the package containing the interface.

It is possible for an object to implement a given interface multiple times, but only distinct implementor ids are counted.

## Example

```json
    <option name="schedMlqueue">

      <parent>kernel</parent>
      <display>Multi-level queue scheduler</display>

      <generatedDefinition>OS_PACKEGE_KERNEL_SCHED_MLQUEUE</generatedDefinition>
      <defaultEnable>true</defaultEnable>
      <implements>kernel/scheduler</implements>
      ...
    </option>
```
