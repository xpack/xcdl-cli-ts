# The `category` definition

:::note

Work in progress. Might not make to the final design.

:::

## Purpose

Specify additional grouping information to enable a configuration tool to provide appropriate selections.

## Syntax

```
    <option name="...">

      <display>...</display>
      <description>...</description>

      <category>string</category>

      ... other properties ...
      ... children objects ...

    </option>
```

The `category` property is a string.

## Default value

If missing no category is assigned to the current object.

## Description

Configuration tools usually should be able to provide some choices to various selections, for example to choose from the hardware platform the build is intended for. For this to work, specific packages should be marked with additional metadata, recognised by the configuration tools.

Examples of such metadata are:

- 'board' - for hardware boards
- 'synthetic' - for synthetic platforms

Other metadata can be purely informative, like the kind of the object:

- 'root'
- 'architecture'
- 'family'

It is recommended to use this extra metadata for `cdlPackage` objects.

## Example

TBD

## eCos reference

- none
