# The `requires` definition

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Purpose

List the constraints that the configuration should enforce or satisfy when a given option is active and enabled.

## Syntax

```json
    <option name="...">

      <display>...</display>
      <description>...</description>

      <requires>expression 1</requires>
      <requires>expression 2</requires>

      ... other properties ...
      ... children objects ...

    </option>
```

The `requires` property is an array of strings containing expressions to be evaluated as boolean.

## Default value

If missing, no additional requirements will be enforced/checked.

## Description

Configuration objects are not independent. For example the C library can provide thread-safe implementations of certain functions, but only if the kernel is present, if the kernel provides multi-threading, and if the kernel options related to per-thread data are enabled. It is possible to express such constraints using `requires` properties.

The arguments to a `requires` property should constitute a list of goal expressions, as described in the Section called List Expressions in [xCDL packages](/docs/guide/packages/). Most goal expressions are relatively simple because the constraints being described are simple, but complicated expressions can be used when necessary. If the object is active and enabled then all these constraints should be satisfied, and any goal expressions which evaluate to 0/false will result in conflicts being raised. It is possible for users to ignore such conflicts and attempt to build the current configuration anyway, but there is no guarantee that anything will work. If an object is inactive or disabled then its `requires` constraints will be ignored.

The configuration system contains an inference engine which can resolve many types of conflicts automatically. For example, if option A is enabled and requires an option B that is currently disabled then the inference engine may attempt to resolve the conflict by enabling B. However this will not always be possible, for example there may be other constraints in the configuration which force B to be disabled at present, in which case user intervention is required.

## Example

```json
    <component name="serialA">

      <parent>powerpc/cogent</parent>
      <display>Cogent PowerPC serial port A driver</display>

      <generatedDefinition>OS_PACKAGE_IO_SERIAL_POWERPC_COGENT_SERIAL_A</generatedDefinition>
      <valueType>none</valueType>
      <defaultEnable>false</defaultEnable>
      <requires>(isEnabled('kernel/interruptsChain') || !isEnabled('io/serial/powerpc/cogent/serialB'))</requires>
      ...
    </component>
```
