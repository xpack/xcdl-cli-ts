# The `configurable` definition

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Purpose

Define whether the current object can be manually changed by the user during the configuration process.

## Syntax

```json {5}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "<key>": {
            ...
            "configurable": true | false | "<boolean expression>",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The value of the `configurable` property is the **true/false** constant or a string containing an expression evaluating to a boolean value.

## Default value

If missing, the default is **true**, all objects are configurable.

## Description

Most of the objects can be individually configured using the configuration (graphical) tools, but some are automatically computed and the user shouldn't be allowed to change them.

Setting `configurable` to false will instruct the configuration tools to no longer allow the user to enable/disable the object and the object will be enabled if it is active and `defaultEnable` is true. For graphical tools, the radio button will be greyed.

Objects marked as non-configurable can still be active or inactive, this property does not affect the functional behaviour during builds, but only the behaviour of the configuration tools.

## Example

TBD


## eCos reference

- none
