# The `activeIf` definition

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Purpose

Allow additional control over the active state of an xCDL configuration object.

## Syntax

```json {5}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "<key>": {
            ...
            "activeIf": [ "<expression>",... ],
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The value of the `activeIf` property is an array of boolean expressions to be evaluated, usually to check hardware properties; if all these expression are true, the active state of this object is true.

## Default value

If missing, no additional constraints are considered, the object is active.

## Description

Configuration options or other objects may be either active or inactive. Typically this is controlled by the object's location in the overall hierarchy. Consider the option `.../utils-lists/trace`, which exists below the component `.../utils-lists`. If the whole component is disabled then all options it contains are inactive: there is no point in enabling trace for the `utils-lists` if the `utils-lists` are not used; any `requires` constraints associated with trace are irrelevant; any `sourceFile` property or other build-related property are ignored.

In some cases the hierarchy does not provide sufficient control over whether or not a particular object should be active. For example, the math library could have support for floating point exceptions which is only worthwhile if the hardware implements appropriate functionality, as specified by the architectural HAL. The relevant math library configuration options should remain below the OS_PACKAGE_LIBM package in the overall hierarchy, but should be inactive unless there is appropriate hardware support. In cases like this an `activeIf` property is appropriate.

Another common use of `activeIf` properties is to avoid excessive nesting in the configuration hierarchy. If some option B is only relevant if option A is enabled, it is possible to turn A into a component that contains B. However adding another level to the hierarchy for a component which will contain just one entry may be considered excessive. In such cases it is possible for B to have an `activeIf` dependency on A.

`activeIf` defines an array of boolean goal expressions all of them have to be satisfied for the object to be active. For details of goal expression syntax see see the Section called Goal Expressions in [XCDL packages](/). In most cases the goal expressions will be very simple, often involving just one other object, but more complicated expressions can be used when appropriate.

The `activeIf` and `requires` properties have certain similarities, but they serve a different purpose. Suppose there are two options A and B, and option B relies on functionality provided by A. This could be expressed as either *B activeIf A* or as *B requires A*. The points to note are:

- If *B activeIf A* is used and A is disabled or inactive, then configuration (graphical) tools will generally prevent any attempt at modifying B. For example the text for B could be greyed out, and the associated check button (if B is a boolean option) would be disabled. If the user needs the functionality provided by option B then it is necessary to go to option A first and manipulate it appropriately.
- If *B requires A* is used and A is disabled or inactive, configuration (graphical) tools will still allow B to be manipulated and enabled. This would result in a new conflict which may get resolved automatically or which may need user intervention.
- If there are hardware dependencies then an `activeIf` condition is usually the preferred approach. There is no point in allowing the user to manipulate a configuration option if the corresponding functionality cannot possibly work on the currently selected hardware. Much the same argument applies to coarse-grained dependencies, for example if an option depends on the presence of a TCP/IP stack then an activeIf OS_PACKAGE_NET condition is appropriate: it may be possible to satisfy the condition, but it requires the fairly drastic step of loading another package; further more, if the user wanted a TCP/IP stack in the configuration then it would probably have been loaded already.
- If option B exists to provide additional debugging information about the functionality provided by A then again an `activeIf` constraint is appropriate. There is no point in letting users enable extra debugging facilities for a feature that is not actually present.
- The configuration system's inference engine will cope equally well with `activeIf` and `requires` properties. Suppose there is a conflict because some third option depends on B. If *B activeIf A* then the inference engine will attempt to make A active and enabled, and then to enable B if necessary. If B requires A then the inference engine will attempt to enable B and resolve the resulting conflict by causing A to be both active and enabled. Although the inference occurs in a different order, in most cases the effect will be the same.

## Examples

Do not provide extra semaphore debugging if there are no semaphores:

```json
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "binsem": {
            ...
            "parent": "kernel/instrument",
            "activeIf": [ "isEnabled('kernel/synch')" ],
            "generatedDefinition": "OS_PACKAGE_KERNEL_SYNCH_MUTEX_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE_SIMPLE_RELAY"
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Avoid another level in the configuration hierarchy:

```json
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "relay": {
            ...
            "parent": "kernel/synch/mutex/priorityInheritance/simple",
            "activeIf": [ "isEnabled('kernel/synch/mutex/priorityInheritance/simple')" ],
            "generatedDefinition": "OS_PACKAGE_KERNEL_SYNCH_MUTEX_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE_SIMPLE_RELAY",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Functionality that is only relevant if another package is loaded:

```json
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "uitron-compatibility": {
            ...
            "parent": "start",
            "activeIf": [ "isLoaded('uitron')" ],
            "generatedDefinition": "OS_PACKAGE_START_UITRON_COMPATIBILITY",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Check that the hardware or HAL provide the appropriate functionality:

```json {6}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "debug-break-support": {
            ...
            "parent": "hal/debug/gdb/break-support",
            "activeIf": [ "isEnabled('hal/debug/gdb/stubs-break')" ],
            "generatedDefinition": "OS_DEBUG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
