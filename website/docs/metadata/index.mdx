# The xCDL Metadata

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

The xCDL metadata is a set of definitions used by `xcdl` to drive the
configuration process.

These definitions are stored in the `xcdl.json` file located in the project
top's folder, as well as in other possible JSON files located in subfolders.

The top folder's `xcdl.json` file must define a `cdlPackage` object.

## Global properties

### `minimumXcdlRequired`

A string with a SemVer.

Defines the minimum version of `xcdl` that can process the xCDL definitions.
