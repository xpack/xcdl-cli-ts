# The `configurable` definition

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Purpose

Specify if the current object can be manually modified by the user during the configuration process.

## Syntax

```json {5}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "<name>": {
            ...
            "configurable": true | false | "<boolean expression>",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The value of the `configurable` property is either a `true`/`false` constant or a string containing an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.

## Default value

If missing, the default is `true`, all objects are configurable.

## Description

Most of the objects can be individually enabled/disabled and/or their values changed using the configuration (graphical) tools; some are `computed` and cannot be changed by the user.

Setting `configurable` to false will instruct the configuration (graphical) tools to prevent the user from enabling or disabling the object. The object will be enabled if it is active and `defaultEnable` is true. For graphical tools, the radio button will be greyed out. Similarly, for objects with data, the editable widget will be greyed out, and the user will not be able to change the value.

Objects marked as non-configurable can still be active or inactive; this property does not affect the functional behaviour during builds, only the behaviour of the configuration tools.

## Example

TBD

## eCos reference

- none
