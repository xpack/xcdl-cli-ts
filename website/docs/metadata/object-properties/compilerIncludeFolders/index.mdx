# The `compilerIncludeFolders` definition

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Purpose

Specify the folders containing public header files that should be included in the build process when this object is active and enabled.

## Syntax

```json {5}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "<name>": {
            ...
            "compilerIncludeFolders": [ "<relative folder path>",... ],
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The value of the `compilerIncludeFolders` property is an array of strings that specify folder paths relative to the current xCDL file. These folders contain header files to be utilized during the build process.

## Default value

If missing, the current object will not contribute any header folders to the build.

## Description

Most packages export one or more folders with header files defining their public interface. For example, the C library exports header files such as `stdio.h` and `ctype.h`. If the package follows the folders layout conventions then the exported header files will normally be found in the package's `include` sub-folder.

It the build artefact is a library, the package's exported header files will be copied to the install tree. This is correct for packages like the C library because that is the correct location for files such as `stdio.h`. However, to reduce the probability of name clashes, it is desirable for packages to use different sub-folders. For example infrastructure header files should use `include/cyg/infra` rather than simply `include`.
