# The `category` definition

:::note

Work in progress. Might not make to the final design.

:::

## Purpose

Specify additional grouping information to enable a configuration tool to provide appropriate selections.

## Syntax

```json {5}
{
    "cdlOptions": {
        "<name>": {
            ...
            "category": "<string>",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The value of the `category` property is a string.

## Default value

If missing no category is assigned to the current object.

## Description

Configuration tools should usually be able to provide choices for various selections, such as choosing the hardware platform for the build. For this to work, specific packages should be marked with additional metadata recognized by the configuration tools.

Examples of such metadata are:

- 'board' - for hardware boards
- 'synthetic' - for synthetic platforms

Other metadata can be purely informative, like the kind of the object:

- 'root'
- 'architecture'
- 'family'

It is recommended to use this extra metadata for `cdlPackage` objects.

## Example

TBD

## eCos reference

- none
