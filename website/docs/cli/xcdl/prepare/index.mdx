# xcdl prepare

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Synopsis

```sh
xcdl prepare [options...] --config <name> --build <folder> --builder <name>
```

Aliases:

- none

## Description

The command reads the named configuration from `xcdl-config.json` (in the current folder) and creates the build tree in the given build folder.

The builder can be:

- `xcdl-make`: generate a GNU make tree, similar to that generated for Eclipse CDT managed builds projects
- `xcdl-ninja`: generate a tree to be built with **ninja**
- `xcdl-internal`: generate a tree to be built with the **xcdl** internal builder

CMake and meson builders will also be considered.

Inspiration:

```
cmake [<options>] -B <path-to-build> [-S <path-to-source>]

meson setup [<options>] [builddir] [sourcedir]
```
