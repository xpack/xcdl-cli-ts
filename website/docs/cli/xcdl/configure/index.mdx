# xcdl configure

:::note

Work in progress.

:::

## Synopsis

```sh
xcdl configure [options...] --config <name>
```

Aliases:

- none

## Description

Add/edit a configuration in `xcdl-config.json`.

If a `cdtConfigurations` object with that name does not exist, it is created.

The configuration process writes the full configuration, with all objects, to the JSON, such that `xcdl prepare` will have all data to create the build tree.
