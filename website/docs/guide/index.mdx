# The xCDL Components Writer's Guide

To manage the potential complexity of multiple components and numerous configuration options, the xPack project includes a component framework: a collection of tools specifically designed to support the configuration of multiple components. Additionally, this component framework is extensible, allowing for the addition of new components to the build system at any time.

This section is intended for those who plan to add metadata to their projects and provides documentation on how to create new component metadata.
