# The xCDL Components Author's Guide

To manage the potential complexity of multiple components and numerous configuration options, the xPack project includes a component framework: a set of **object definitions** and a collection of **tools** specifically designed to support the configuration of multiple components.

This section is intended for those who plan to add xCDL metadata to their projects and provides documentation on how to create new configuration options metadata.
