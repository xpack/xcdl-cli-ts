# xcdl.json

## Overview

Projects with source code that are designed to be included as libraries
in other projects need a way to define the xCDL package metadata.

Component authors can use any name and place the file in any location, but the
default is to use `xcdl.json` and place the file in the project top folder.

## Example

```json
{
    "minimumXcdlRequired": "2.0.0",
    
}
```
