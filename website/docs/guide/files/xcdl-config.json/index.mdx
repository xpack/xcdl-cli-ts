# xcdl-config.json

## Overview

The `xcdl-config.json` file is used to store the project xCDL configurations.

Component authors can use any name and place the file in any location, but the
default is to use `xcdl-config.json` and place the file where the source tree is, for example the project top folder for user applications or the `tests` folder.
