# Terms used across the **xcdl** project

### CDL

**CDL** stands for **Component Definition Language**. It was introduced
by eCos and is documented in [The eCos Component Writer's Guide](http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-3.0/cdl-guide/cdl-guide.html).

### xCDL

**xCDL** is the xPack Configuration Definition Language and framework,
inspired by eCos CDL.

xCDL uses several concepts inherited from eCos CDL:

- xCDL **software component**: a set of source files that perform a given
function, standalone or depending on other components, together with
some metadata
- xCDL **component metadata**: additional informations added to
software components to describe dependencies, requirements and constraints
- xCDL **configuration tools**: tools running on development machines
to create and manage xCDL configurations and component metadata
- xCDL **configurations**: specific metadata definitions, that describe
the requirements of an application, like which components are used, the values for preprocessor definitions, toolchain selection, build details, etc
- xCDL **build configurations**: the result of processing an xCDL
configuration, usually a build folder with associated build related
files (like CMake/meson/GNU Make files); when IDEs (like VS Code or Eclipse) are used, it translates to an IDE build configuration
- xCDL **requirements**: direct requirements, generally components
that are mandatory for the build to succeed, like base classes
- xCDL **constraints**: in general hardware dependencies, like the
presence of a certain peripheral, but dependencies to software
options can also be used

The xPack build configurations and xCDL build configurations
should be more or less the same, but details should be worked out.
