# Terms used across the **xcdl** project

The definitions used in the xCDL project are listed below.

More elaborate definitions are available in the
[Concepts](/docs/guide/concepts/) page.

### CDL

**CDL** stands for **Component Definition Language**. It was introduced
by eCos and is documented in
[The eCos Component Writer's Guide](http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-3.0/cdl-guide/cdl-guide.html).

### xCDL

**xCDL** is the xPack Configuration Definition Language and framework,
inspired by eCos CDL.

xCDL uses several concepts inherited from eCos CDL:

- **software component**: a set of source files that perform a given
function, standalone or depending on other components, together with
some metadata
- **component metadata**: additional informations added to
software components to describe dependencies, requirements and constraints
- **configuration tools**: tools running on development machines
to create and manage xCDL configurations and component metadata
- **configurations**: specific metadata definitions, that describe
the requirements of an application, like which components are used,
the values for preprocessor definitions, toolchain selection, build
details, etc
- **build configurations**: the result of processing an xCDL
configuration, usually a build folder with associated build related
files (like CMake/meson/GNU Make files); when used together
with **xpm**, it is recommended that
xCDL build configurations share the same names; this can
be easily achieved by invoking **xcdl** via **xpm** actions and
passing `{{configuration.name}}`
- **requirements**: direct requirements, generally components
that are needed by other components in order for the build to succeed
- **constraints**: in general hardware dependencies, like the
presence of a certain peripheral; dependencies to software
options can also be used
