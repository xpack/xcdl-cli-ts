# Terms used across the **xcdl** project

The definitions used in the xCDL project are listed below.

More elaborate definitions are available in the
[Concepts](/docs/guide/concepts/) page.

### CDL

**CDL** stands for **Component Definition Language**. It was introduced
by eCos and is documented in
[The eCos Component Writer's Guide](http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-3.0/cdl-guide/cdl-guide.html).

### xCDL

**xCDL** is the xPack Configuration Definition Language and framework,
inspired by eCos CDL.

xCDL uses several concepts inherited from eCos CDL:

- **software component**: a set of source files that perform a given
function, standalone or depending on other components, together with
some metadata.
- **component metadata**: additional informations added to
software components to describe dependencies, requirements and constraints.
- **configuration tools**: tools running on development machines
to create and manage xCDL configurations and component metadata.
- **configurations**: specific metadata definitions, that describe
the requirements of an application, like which components are used,
the values for preprocessor definitions, toolchain selection, build
details, etc.
- **build configurations**: the outcome of processing an xCDL
configuration, typically resulting in a build folder containing
associated build-related files (such as CMake, Meson, or GNU Make
files). When utilised in conjunction with **xpm**, the xCDL
configuration serves as a parameter for the xpm build configuration.
Multiple build configurations can be derived from the same
xCDL configuration, for instance, when building the same
unit test with various versions of a toolchain.
- **requirements**: direct requirements, generally components
that are needed by other components in order for the build to succeed.
- **constraints**: in general hardware dependencies, like the
presence of a certain peripheral; dependencies to software
options can also be used.
