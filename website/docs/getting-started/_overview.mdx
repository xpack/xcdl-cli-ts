By design, the xPack framework aims to automate:

- managing **dependencies**
- managing **build configurations**
- **component** configurations
- the **build** process

While the management of dependencies & build configurations is handled by **xpm**,
the configuration & build processes are covered by **xcdl**.

[CDL - Component Definition Language](https://ecos.sourceware.org/ecos/docs-latest/cdl-guide/cdl-guide.html)
is an advanced technology for configuring and building projects,
introduced by the [eCos](https://ecos.sourceware.org)
free open-source real-time operating system, which is intended for embedded applications.

xCDL is inspired by CDL, but utilises a new TypeScript implementation and is part
of the Node.js ecosystem.

<summary>Why not `kconfig`?</summary>

Another configuration mechanism is implemented by
[Kconfig](https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/kconfig-language.html#),
a tool part of the Linux ecosystem and used to configure the
Linux kernel.

Although the goals are somehow similar, the concepts differ.
The language employs a custom syntax, and generally,
using it for typical embedded projects can be a challenge.

As a brief definition, an xCDL **component** is a generic unit of
functionality that includes one or more related source files.
These files share common configuration data (such as preprocessor
definitions) and are compiled using the same compilation options.

Using `xcdl` with existing components is relatively straightforward.
That said, creating new components or adding the xCDL metadata to
an existing project requires an understanding of the xCDL concepts
and metadata, which are documented in the
[Components Writer's Guide](/docs/guide/).
