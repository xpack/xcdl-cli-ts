## What is xcdl?

**xcdl**, short for **x**Pack **CDL**, is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CommonJS  module and a CLI
application designed to **automate component** and **builds**
for C/C++ projects. It draws inspiration from eCos CDL.

[CDL - Component Definition Language](https://ecos.sourceware.org/ecos/docs-latest/cdl-guide/cdl-guide.html)
is an advanced technology for configuring and building projects,
introduced by the [eCos](https://ecos.sourceware.org)
free open-source real-time operating system, which is intended for embedded applications.

xCDL was inspired by CDL but, as part
of the Node.js ecosystem, it migrated the original Tcl configuration
scripts to JSON files and reimplemented the logic in TypeScript.

### What is a component?

As a brief definition, an xCDL **component** is a generic unit of
functionality that includes one or more related source files.
These files share common configuration data (such as preprocessor
definitions) and are compiled together, using the same compilation
options.

### Components Author's Guide

Using `xcdl` with existing components is relatively straightforward.
Creating new components or adding the xCDL metadata to
an existing project is a bit more difficult and
requires an understanding of the xCDL **concepts**
and **metadata**, which are documented in the
[Components Author's Guide](/docs/guide/).

## Features

By design, the xPack framework aims to automate:

- managing **dependencies**
- managing **build configurations**
- the **component configurations** process
- the **build** process

While the management of dependencies & build configurations is handled by **xpm**,
the configuration & build processes are covered by **xcdl**.

**xcdl** enhances cross-platform builds and tests with its distinctive features:

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Operates seamlessly on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **GNU/Linux**.
- **Compile-time configurability**: Allows behaviour to be controlled during compilation.
- **Per-component source files**: Divides the project into components, each with its own set of source files.
- **Per-option preprocessor definitions**: When components and options are individually enabled or disabled, this determines which lines are generated in a configuration header file. Specifically, each enabled component or option triggers the generation of corresponding `#define` statements in the header file.
- **Enforce constraints**: Components and options can define ranges of values and/or interdependencies with other objects.
- **Build Configurations**: Manages multiple build configurations, such as debug/release builds or platform-specific tests.

## Benefits

- Being able to develop exactly the same project on Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux provides team members with the flexibility to use their preferred platform.
- Disabled components automatically have their source files excluded from the build process, allowing for coarse granularity in excluding unused code.
- Automatically generated preprocessor definitions allow for precise control over the inclusion of code and data, ensuring that only the necessary elements are compiled.
- Compile-time control at the individual statement level optimises the build process by excluding unnecessary code, leading to more efficient and manageable projects.
- Enforcing constraints enables to:
  - generate a consistent set of preprocessor definitions
  - validate the configuration even before the compilation step
- Managing separate configurations for multiple build setups facilitates convenient testing across different platforms, such as native and/or embedded.
