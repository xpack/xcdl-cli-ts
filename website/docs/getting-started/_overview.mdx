By design, the xPack framework aims to automate:

- dependencies management
- build configurations
- component configurations

The first two are handled by **xpm**. The third will be covered by **xcdl**.

The details are still to be worked on, but the general idea is to stay
as close to eCos CDL as possible.

Another distant possible source of inspiration might be the Linux
[Kconfig Language](https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/kconfig-language.html#),
but the concepts might be different.

As a first definition, in xCDL a **component** is a generic unit
of functionality, that
includes one or more related source files. These files share common
configuration data (like preprocessor definitions) and are
compiled using the same compilation options.
