## Overview

**XCDL** is the component & configuration framework. The name unveils [eCos CDL](https://ecos.sourceware.org/ecos/docs-3.0/cdl-guide/reference.html) (Component Definition Language) as the initial source of inspiration.

In a later iteration, XCDL was extended to include definitions from [CMSIS PDSC](https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/Pack/html/packFormat.html).

## Purpose

The **XCDL** files are used to

* define the device features
* define the platform/board features
* define the software components and configurations (TBD)

File formats

* [xcdl.json]({{ site.baseurl }}/metadata/devices/)
