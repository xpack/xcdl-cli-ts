# utils-lists

This example follows the CMake/meson layout, with multiple files,
which make editing by hand more convenient.

However, for GUI usage, one file per location would be more appropriate.

Also, with single files per location, probably the `meta` folder makes less
sense, and the files can have the same name (`xpmake.json`).
