## The _cdlOption_ object

### Purpose

Define an option, as a single configuration choice.

### Syntax

```json
{
  "cdlOptions": {
    "name": {
      "description": "...",
      "...": "... other properties ..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Description

The _cdlOption_ object is the basic unit of configurability.
Generally each option corresponds to a single user choice.
An option may be a simple enable/disable choice or it may hold a value
for something more
complicated such as an array size or a device name.
Options may have associated constraints, so if that option is enabled then
certain conditions have to be satisfied elsewhere in the configuration.
Options usually have direct consequences such as preprocessor `#define`
symbols in a configuration header file.

Options are objects with a name and a body. Within a parent node, names
must be unique.

The user choice is expressed during the configuration process and is
reflected in the enabled/disabled statues of the option. For options with
associated values, it is also possible for the user to define a value (if
missing, a default value, either implicit or defined as the property
`defaultValue`, is applied). For these options it is also possible to define
some limits on the possible values that the user can choose.

A separate class of options are the computed options, whose values cannot
be set by the user, but are computed according to a given expression.

### Containers

Options are not containers, so they cannot hold other objects.

### Properties

- _parent_: the id of the parent node
- _valueType_: the type of the variable associated with this option
  (none, boolean, integer, float, string)
- _defaultEnable_: a boolean (constant or expression?) that provides an initial
  value for the option enabled/disabled state; default is false
- _defaultValue_: an expression to be used as a default value for this
  option, when the user does not define it explicitly during the
  configuration process
- _generatedDefinition_ - a valid C preprocessor identifier to be
  defined in the header file if the option is active and enabled
- _generatedFile_ - the full path file name of the header where the option
  will generate a definition (if missing, inherited from the parent node)
- _activeIf_: an array of expressions to be evaluated; if all are true,
  the active state of this option remains true (TODO: work details)
- _implementedInterfaces_: array of references to CDL nodes
- _dependencies_: an array of IDs of other objects to be enabled when this
  option is enabled
- _legalValues_: an array of strings with values and ranges
- TODO: add other

### GUI

In a GUI, the _cdlOption_ object is a leaf node in a configuration tree, with:

- an icon
- the name
- the description as a tooltip
- a radio button to enable/disable the option (always on for mandatory options)
- (optional) an edit widget to edit the value or a select widget to select
  from a list.

## The _cdlComponent_ object

### Purpose

Define a component, as a collection of configuration objects.

### Syntax

```json
{
  "cdlComponents": {
    "name": {
      "description": "...",
      "...": "... other properties ...",
      "cdlOptions": {},
      "cdlComponents": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Description

The _cdlComponent_ object is a configuration element that can contain
additional options and subcomponents. A _component_ can have the
same properties as an _option_ plus more.

Components are objects with a name and a body. Within a parent node, names
must be unique.

Similarly to _cdlOption_ objects, if active and enabled, _cdlComponent_ objects
can generate preprocessor `#define` lines in a configuration header file,
and decide if a set of source files are included in the build process.

### Containers

Components are containers, so it is possible for a component to include
_cdlComponent_, _cdlOption_, _cdlInterface_ objects that
should go below this object in the configuration hierarchy.
These objects can be defined either as embedded children, or can be
read from included files.

### Properties

In addition to those available for _cdlOption_ (except _valueType_):

- _compilerSourceFiles_: array of paths to source files
- _compileIncludeFolders_: array of paths to folders with header files
- _compilerDefinitions_: array of preprocessor symbols
- _compilerOptions_: array of compiler options
- _dependencies_: array of references to CDL dependent nodes,
  usually components that need
  to be built before the current component

Possibly language specific:

- _cCompileIncludeFolders_: array of paths to folders with header files
- _cCompilerDefinitions_: array of preprocessor symbols
- _cCompilerOptions_: array of compiler options
- _cppCompilerIncludeFolders_: array of paths to folders with header files
- _cppCompilerDefinitions_: array of preprocessor symbols
- _cppCompilerOptions_: array of compiler options

## The _cdlInterface_ object

### Purpose

Define an interface, a functionality that can be provided by a
number of different implementations.

### Syntax

```json
{
  "cdlInterface": {
    "architecture": {
      "description": "The generic architecture",
      "parent": "micro-os-plus",
      "maxImplementations": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Description

An _cdlInterface_ is a special type of computed option object.
The value of an interface is the number of implementers that
are active and enabled.

Interfaces are objects with a name and a body. Within a parent node, names
must be unique.

### Containers

Interfaces are not containers, so they cannot hold other entities
such as options or components.

### Properties

- _legalValues_: an array of strings with values and/or ranges;
  default [ '0', '1' ]
- _generatedDefinition_ - a valid C preprocessor identifier to be
  defined in the header file if the interface is active and enabled
  (i.e. it is implemented)
